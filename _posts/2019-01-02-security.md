### Authentication

The MonitorQA API uses API Key authentication for secure access to all endpoints. Authentication is required for all API requests.

#### How to Authenticate

Include your API key in the `X-API-KEY` header with every request:

```http
GET /audits HTTP/1.1
Host: api-external.monitorqa.com
X-API-KEY: abcdef12345
Content-Type: application/json
```

#### Generating Your API Key

1. Log in to your MonitorQA account
2. Navigate to <a href="https://app.monitorqa.com/settings/integration" target="_blank">Settings → Integration</a>
3. Generate a new API key or copy your existing key
4. Store the key securely - it provides full access to your account data

#### Security Best Practices

- Keep your API key confidential and secure
- Never expose API keys in client-side code or public repositories
- Regenerate your key if it becomes compromised
- Use HTTPS for all API requests
