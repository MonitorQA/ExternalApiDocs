Webhooks provide real-time notifications when audit and corrective action events occur in your MonitorQA account. Configure webhooks to receive instant updates and integrate seamlessly with your external systems.

## Setup

To configure webhooks for your MonitorQA account, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your MonitorQA account
2. Navigate to the Settings page
3. Select the [Integration](https://app.monitorqa.com/settings/integration) section
4. Find the Webhooks or Custom Integrations option
5. Specify the webhook URL where MonitorQA will send notifications

## Functionality

MonitorQA sends HTTP POST requests containing JSON-formatted data whenever audit or corrective action events occur within the system. This webhook mechanism ensures real-time updates and seamless integration with external systems.

## Response Requirements

| Requirement | Value | Description |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| Response Time | 10 seconds maximum | Your system must respond within this timeframe to ensure smooth communication |
| Retry Policy | Up to 5 attempts | MonitorQA will automatically retry failed webhook deliveries |
| Content Type | `application/json` | All webhook payloads are sent as JSON |

## Network Reliability

In case of network errors or response timeouts, MonitorQA implements a robust retry mechanism to ensure message delivery reliability even in challenging network conditions.

## Webhook Message Format

All webhook messages follow a consistent JSON structure with an `event` field that varies based on the type of event (audit, corrective action, or template).

### Base Message Structure

```json
{
  "event": "<EVENT>",
  "data": {
    // Event-specific data
  },
  "company": {
    "id": "db2b640b-a8f5-4af6-277a-08db091985f7",
    "name": "Company Name"
  }
}
```

## Audit Events

### Message Format

```json
{
  "event": "<EVENT>",
  "data": {
    "auditId": "db2b640b-a8f5-4af6-277a-08db091985f7"
  },
  "company": {
    "id": "db2b640b-a8f5-4af6-277a-08db091985f7",

```

### Event Types

## Corrective Action Events

### Message Format
