### Setup
To seamlessly integrate with MonitorQA, you’ll need to configure the webhook URL in the Settings section under <a href="https://app.monitorqa.com/settings/integration" target="_blank">Integration</a>  on the MonitorQA website. Follow these simple steps:
1. Log in to your MonitorQA account.
2. Navigate to the Settings page.
3. Locate the Integrations section and select it.
4. In the Integrations menu, find the option for Webhooks or Custom Integrations.
5. Specify the webhook URL where MonitorQA will send notifications.

### Functionality
MonitorQA operates by sending HTTP POST requests containing JSON-formatted data whenever audit or corrective events occur within the system. This webhook mechanism ensures real-time updates and allows for seamless integration with external systems.

### Response Time
When MonitorQA sends a notification, it expects a response within a certain timeframe to ensure timely processing. The maximum allowable response time, or timeout period, is set to 10 seconds. This means that your system should acknowledge or process the incoming request within this timeframe to ensure smooth communication between MonitorQA and your application.

### Retry Policy
In the event of a network error or if the response from your system exceeds the specified timeout period, MonitorQA implements a retry mechanism to ensure message delivery. The system will automatically retry sending the notification up to a maximum of 5 times. This ensures robustness and reliability in communication between MonitorQA and your application, even in less-than-ideal network conditions.
